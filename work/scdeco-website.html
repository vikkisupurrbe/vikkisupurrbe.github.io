            <p class="project-paragraph project-paragraph-problem">
                During the 3 years I worked at SCdeco, although the website had been updated over and over to promote the business, 
                whether the customer would find it useful was rarely considered. I found that the company's website was failing to help clients' 
                goals to understand different types of apparel decoration services the company provides, to find out about the cost of the services, 
                and to facilitate the communication about their inquiries.

            <p class="project-section-subtitle">Survey</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The original website is neither well-known nor used often by most of the customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Method:</strong> Google Forms survey, done amongst 6 customers, 3 have been doing business with SCdeco for over
                10 years, 3 just started last year
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Results:</strong> Shown in the charts and summary below

            <p>
                The customer profile shown below describes SCdeco's customers' <strong>jobs</strong> (shown in yellow sticky notes), 
                <strong>pains</strong> (shown in orange sticky notes), and <strong>gains</strong> (shown in green sticky notes). The 
                jobs, pains, and gains are ranked from high to low based on the level significance, from top to bottom. This graph helped 
                me build the key features of the new SCdeco website by prioritizing the value of increasing customer satisfaction.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Defining the goals</h2>

                The value map consists of three parts, gain creators, pain relievers, and product & services. They are a reflection of the 
                customer profile in customer profile. Gain creators are the possible reasons that may increase customer satisfaction in the 
                ordering process. Pain relivers are the possible solutions to customer's concerns. Product and services are new features the 
                redesigned website focus on. And the goals are to implement these new features in the new website.
            </p>
            <p>
                SCdeco's customers main goals are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To find the most cost-effective decoration method(s) for their projects</li>
                <li>To make sure the order can be finished and delivered with in the given period of time</li>

                Existing users can jump into quoting, or they can also use the quote calculator to compare between different decoration 
                methods to see which one is more cost-effective. A design tool is also available for users to visualize their ideas. 
                After an order is placed, the user can log in to their account to check the status of the order.

            <img src="../media/User Test - Participants.jpg">
            <p>
                3 users participated in the usability test of the protype of the redesigned Stitches Creation website. They come from 
                different age groups, and they have different levels of confidence with technology.
            </p>

            <p class="project-section-subtitle">Tasks and User Performance</p>
            <img src="../media/User Test - Method.png">
            <p>
                Above is a list of 3 tasks for 3 different scenarios, searching for the best decoration method, designing the look of 
                supplied garments, and tracking the order status. The cells highlighted in green indicate that the user completed the 
                task within the estimated time.
            </p>

            <p class="project-section-subtitle">Results</p>
            <p>
                All 3 participants found that the redesigned website was fairly easy to use. User 1 and User 2 gained more understanding 
                of the ordering process at Stitches Creation and the user workflow. User 3 gave the new website a lot of compliments 
                because she thought the workflow of the newly designed website was self-explanatory and more efficient compared to the 
                old website.
            </p>
            <img src="../media/User Test - Performance.jpg">
            <p>
                *In Scenario B, Task 1, none of the 3 users could find the design tool within the estimated time limit. This is because 
                in Scenario A, the user stopped on the quote page after they were done obtaining a quote. The design tool was not shown 
                on the quote page. And the only way to find it is to go back to the homepage. 
            </p>
            <p>
                *In Scenario C, Task 1, the user should have been able to click “log in” to start scenario C, but they could not do that 
                because the button was un-clickable at the end of Scenario B. This problem was fixed later by making the uploaded logo 
                disappear by clicking anywhere on the page.

            <h2>What I would do better next time</h2>
            <p>
                This is my first UX project. Besides the general process of UX design, I also learned that involving stakeholders like a 
                developer and a manager in the early stage of the design is crucial in deciding what is possible and what is not. Here are 
                a few things I would do better next time:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Include key features in global navigation menu so that it is easier for the user to locate what they need without 
                    looking around on the website
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make the transition between each user tasks more smooth before starting usability tests
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide users with instructions in the usability test as clear as possible
                </li>
                <li>
                    Involve stakeholders in the early stage to figure out their interest and the limitations
                </li>
